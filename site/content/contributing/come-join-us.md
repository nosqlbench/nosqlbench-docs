There are multiple ways to contribute to NoSQLBench. The project is growing, and it needs many 
hands to help it be as awesome as it can be. Ways to contribute include: improving the 
documentation, submitting bug reports, reproducing bugs, providing bugfixes, submitting ideas 
for new features, helping with design discussion, contributing drivers or other core features, 
or even improving the CI/CD in github actions.

There is also a need to get the word out and show new users how to use various features, so if 
this is something you particularly enjoy, please jump in.

Other than that, we're always happy to find ways for contributors to get engaged, so if you are
interested but don't know how to get started, join us on our
[discord server](https://discord.gg/dBHRakusMN) and we can figure something out.

**CLA or contributor covenants**

NoSQLBench does not presently have a contributor covenant or CLA (Contributor Licensing Agreement), 
but this may be added if necessary. In general, we try to keep the friction low for new 
contributors. The main two things you have to agree to contribute to NoSQLBench are:

* Adhere to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* License all of your contributions with the [Apache Public License, version 2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
* In your license header, use the project name `nosqlbench` as the copyright holder.[^1]

[^1]: <sub>If this is not agreeable to anybody, we will need to setup a CLA or something similar 
to ensure that the project can evolve as needed without chasing down copyright holders or 
replacing abandoned code in the future. We'd like to keep things simpler than this, but we will 
consider it if significant contributions justify a change.</sub>
