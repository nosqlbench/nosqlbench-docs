# Assumptions

- You are using IntelliJ to work with the NoSQLBench code base.
- You want IntelliJ to automatically apply the license files when needed on files you edit.

# Steps

1. Enable the bundled `copyright` plugin
2. Under File | Settings | Editor | Copyright | Copyright Profiles, add one named 'aplv2'.

- Set the copyright text (velocity template) to:
```
Copyright (c) $originalComment.match("Copyright \(c\) (\d+)", 1, "-", "$today.year")$today.year nosqlbench

- Set the `Regex to detect copyright in comments` to:
```

```

You can click the validate button to confirm that the velocity template works.
