title: jmx driver

The JMX Driver allows you to do various JMX operations against a JMX service URL
and object name.

You must specify the service URL and object name in the op template. Alternately, you can specify
the protocol, host, port and path. Each cycle, the full JMX operation is derived from the
op template, and executed.

In the first version of this driver, only reads are supported.

# Connection Options

JMX transports can be configured in a myriad of ways. The options below allow you to add
connection options such as SSL and authentication.
- **username** - The username to authenticate to the JMX server as. This can be specifed as the
  actual username to use, or 'file:...' to indicate a filename to load the user name from, or as
   'console:' to force the user name to be prompted for on the console. If an empty value is provided,
   then the console is used by default.
- **password** - The password to authentiate to the JMX server with. This can be specifed as the
  actual password to use, or 'file:...' to indicate a filename to load the user name from, or as
  'console:' to force the user name to be prompted for on the console. If an empty value is provided,
   then the console is used by default.

# Example Operations

## readvar

The readvar operation is used to read a named attribute of the named object and store it in the
thread local variable map.

```yaml
statements:
  - read1:
     url: service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://dsehost:7199/jmxrmi
     object: org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=Compaction,name=PendingTasks
     readvar: Value
     as_type: int
     as_name: pending_tasks     
     # process or thread, process is default
     scope: process
```

The `as_type` and `as_name`, and `scope` are optional, and if provided will set the name and
data type used in the thread local variable map, and whether the variable is stored in the
thread scope or the process (global) scope.

- *as_type* can be any of long, int, double, float, byte, short, or String. If the original type
is convertable to a number, then it will be converted to a number and then to the desired type. If it
is not, it will be converted to String form first and then to the desired type. If the type name
contains dots, as in a fully-qualified class name, then direct class casting will be used if the
types are compatible.

- *as_name* will change the name used to store the value in the map.

- *scope* can be either `thread` or `process` and determines the scope of the varaible map
  which is used to store the variable.

A combined format is available if you don't want to put every command property on a separate line.
In this format, the first entry in the command map is taken as the command name and a set of key=value
command arguments. It is semantically equivalent to the above example, only more compact.

```yaml
statements:
  - read1: readvar=Value as_type=int as_name=pending_tasks    
    url: service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://dsehost:7199/jmxrmi
    object: org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=Compaction,name=PendingTasks
```

## printvar

If you want to simply read a value from a metric and print it out on stdout, you can do it with
the `printvar` command. This is identical to the readvar command except that it puts the resulting
variable (after any as_name and as_type options are applied) on the console.

```yaml
statements:
  - read1: printvar=Value as_type=int as_name=pending_tasks     
    url: service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://dsehost:7199/jmxrmi
    object: org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=Compaction,name=PendingTasks
```

This will produce an output like this:

```yaml
# read JMX attribute ' Value' as class java.lang.Integer as_type=int as_name=pending_tasks
pending_tasks=0
```

## explain

If you want to see the details about a managed object, you can use the explain command:

```yaml
statements:
  - explain1:
     url: service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://dsehost:7199/jmxrmi
     object: org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=Compaction,name=PendingTasks
     explain: object
```

This will use the MBeanInfo to interrogate the named management bean and provide a summary
of it's available attriburtes, operations, notifications, and constructors to stdout.
This is not meant for bulk testing, but more for explaining and documenting JMX beans.

The above example will produce an output like this:

```text
### MBeanInfo for 'org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=Compaction,name=PendingTasks'
# classname: org.apache.cassandra.metrics.CassandraMetricsRegistry$JmxGauge
# Information on the management interface of the MBean
## attributes:
# Attribute exposed for management
- 'Value' type=java.lang.Objectreadable=true writable=false is_is=false
## operations:
# Operation exposed for management
- objectName() -> javax.management.ObjectName impact=UNKNOWN
```
