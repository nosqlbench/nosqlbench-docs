title: "00 Designing Workloads"
weight: 0
---


Workloads in nosqlbench are always controlled by a workload definition. Even the built-in workloads
are simply pre-configured and controlled from a YAML file which is bundled internally.

With nosqlbench a standard configuration format is provided that is used across all activity types.
This makes it easy to specify op templates, parameters, data bindings, and tags. This section
describes the standard YAML format and how to use it.

It is recommended that you read through the examples in each of the design sections in order. This
guide was designed to give you a detailed understanding of workload construction with nosqlbench.
The examples will also give you better insight into how nosqlbench works at a fundamental level.

ðŸ‘‰ To align to new API features and concepts, the term _statement_ has been generalized to
_operation_. The YAML `statements` property is supported as `ops`, and a variety of new forms are
supported. These will be provided as examples in a future docs update.

## Multi-Protocol Support

You will notice that this guide is not overly CQL-specific. That is because NoSQLBench is a
multi-protocol tool. All that is needed for you to use this guide with other protocols is the use of
a different activity type. Try to keep that in mind as you think about designing workloads.

## Advice for new builders

### Look for built-ins first

If you haven't yet run NoSQLBench with a built-in workload, then this section may not be necessary
reading. It is possible that a built-in workload will do what you need. If not, please read on.

### Review existing examples

The built-in workloads that are include with nosqlbench are also easy to copy out as a starting
point. You just need to use two commands:

    # find a workload you want to copy
    nb --list-workloads


    # copy a workload to your local directory
    nb --copy cql-iot

### Follow the conventions

The tagging conventions described under the YAML Conventions section will make your testing go
smoother. All of the baselines that we publish for nosqlbench will use this form.
