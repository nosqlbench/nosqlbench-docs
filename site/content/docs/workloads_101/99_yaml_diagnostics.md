This section describes errors that you might see if you have a YAML loading issue, and what you can do to fix them.

### Undefined Name-Statement Tuple

This exception is thrown when the statement body is not found in a statement definition in any of the supported formats.
For example, the following block will cause an error:

```yaml
statements:
 - name: statement-foo
   params:
    aparam: avalue
```

This is because `name` and `params` are reserved property names -- removed from the list of name-value pairs before free
parameters are read. If the statement is not defined before free parameters are read, then the first free parameter is
taken as the name and statement in `name: statement` form.

To correct this error, supply a statement property in the map, or simply replace the `name: statement-foo` entry with a
`statement-foo: statement body` at the top of the map:

Either of these will work:

```yaml
statements:
 - name: statement-foo
   stmt: statement body
   params:
    aparam: avalue
---
statements:
 - statement-foo: statement body
   params:
    aparam: avalue
```

In both cases, it is clear to the loader where the statement body should come from, and what (if any) explicit naming
should occur.

### Redefined Name-Statement Tuple

This exception is thrown when the statement name is defined in multiple ways. This is an explicit exception to avoid
possible ambiguity about which value the user intended. For example, the following statements definition will cause an
error:

```yaml
statements:
 - name: name1
   name2: statement body
```

This is an error because the statement is not defined before free parameters are read, and the `name: statement` form
includes a second definition for the statement name. In order to correct this, simply remove the separate `name` entry,
or use the `stmt` property to explicitly set the statement body. Either of these will work:

```yaml
statements:
 - name2: statement body
---
statements:
 - name: name1
   stmt: statement body
```

In both cases, there is only one name defined for the statement according to the supported formats.

### YAML Parsing Error

This exception is thrown when the YAML format is not recognizable by the YAML parser. If you are not working from
examples that are known to load cleanly, then please review your document for correctness according to the
[YAML Specification](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/).

If you are sure that the YAML should load, then please
[submit a bug report](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=bug) with details on the type of YAML
file you are trying to load.

### YAML Construction Error

This exception is thrown when the YAML was loaded, but the configuration object was not able to be constructed from the
in-memory YAML document. If this error occurs, it may be a bug in the YAML loader implementation. Please
[submit a bug report](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/issues/new?labels=bug) with details on the type of YAML
file you are trying to load.
