# NoSQLBench - CQL-Starter

{{ img(src="/blog/start_here.png" alt="Start Here" w=300 h=200) }}

## Introduction

Welcome to the NoSQLBench Quick Byte, the first session in a “Getting Started” series for 
NoSQLBench. This session introduces a new Cassandra Query Language (CQL) starter workload now 
available in version 5 of NoSQLBench.

* If you haven't heard of NoSQLBench, checkout our [introduction material](@/introduction/_index.md)
* If you already have a foundation with NoSQLBench and would like to understand what's included 
  in the most recent version, checkout the [release notes](@/release-notes/_index.md).

This session illustrates use of CQL, using NoSQLBench v5, along with a Docker deployment of 
 Apache Cassandra 4.1 using its latest image.

Let’s get rolling …

## Setup

This session was tested with:

* Ubuntu (v20.4)
* Docker(v20.10.18)
* NoSQLBench (v5.17.2)
* Apache Cassandra (v4.1)

### 01 Docker

Ensure Docker is installed on your operation system. You can download it from
[https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)

### 02 Get NB5

Obtain official NB5 release, if you don't already have it, from
[latest nb5 release](https://github.com/nosqlbench/nosqlbench/releases/latest/download/nb5),
and then `chmod +x nb5`.

See [get nosqlbench](getting-started/00-get-nosqlbench.md) for other download options.

You should be able to see your version installed using:

```shell
./nb5 --version
```

### 03 Cassandra

Run the latest Cassandra 4.* docker.

```shell
docker run --name cass4 -p 9042:9042 -d cassandra
```

If you have issues, more details can be found at
[Apache Cassandra on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/cassandra).


Verify Cassandra is started from logs:

```shell
docker container logs <your-container-id>
```

# Running the scenario

Now, we are ready to run the cql-starter NoSQLBench scenario.

1. Navigate via your local command line to where the nb5 binary was previously downloaded.
2. Ensure that issuing the following command identifies the workload used for this session.

```shell
./nb5 --list-workloads | grep cql-starter
```

Example output:

```shell
/activities/baselines/cql-starter.yaml
```

An alternative is to copy the workload configuration listed below to your own local file in a 
folder of your choosing. You can name it whatever you like, as you will specify the absolute 
file path directly when issuing the scenario command.

## CQL workload template

This YAML file is designed as a basic foundation for continuing to learn NoSQLBench 
capabilities as well as a starting point for customizing for your own testing needs.

You will notice that the number of cycles are minimal to support local testing to ensure that 
your configuration is constructed properly.  When customizing these for real-world tests, the 
values can be set to millions or more!  That is where the full power of NoSQLBench shines to 
generate critical metrics for analysis to make a system more robust.

```


Before running NoSQLBench scenario, let’s take a look at the layout of the file.  Most of this 
will be the same layout structure used in all NB5 workload files so this helps to reveal a 
large amount of the basics. This is called a _workload template_.

Starting from the top of the workload template, the primary sections include:

* Description - A way to describe what the workload does.
* Scenarios - A set of named scenarios for detailing the intent of the workload and defines that for various blocks (e.g. schema, rampup, main, etc.).
* Params - Optional parameters of interest to reference for applying values.
* Bindings - Named recipes for generated data.  These are referenced in block operations.
* Blocks - Where the labeled operations reside (e.g. schema, rampup, and main).
    * Schema - A block section where the schema is actually defined and created.
    * Rampup - A block section for data setup that becomes the backdrop for testing; it’s the density of data outside the metrics collected in the main block.
    * Main - A block section that is the target of metrics collection activities.

This may look overwhelming at first glance, but the magic of what can be done for load testing 
 target resources becomes more apparent as settings are tweaked for various test cases.

### Basic Operations

The workload operations in the cql-starter are quite basic, and this is on purpose.  The intent 
is to focus on a simple set of read and write operations to understand how to work with 
NoSQLBench and Cassandra using basic, direct CQL.

### Table and Keyspace

For the default scenario, a simple table named ‘cqlstarter’ will be created with a keyspace 
 named ‘starter’.  There will be three fields for our table:

* machine_id
* message
* time

The machine_id is a unique identifier type, the message field is a text type, and the time is a 
 timestamp type.

Since the example is designed to be run locally, the Cassandra keyspace replication is defined 
 using a SimpleStrategy with a replication factor of 1.

```
WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '<<rf:1>>'}
```

### Default scenario

For this session, the ‘default’ scenario is being used.

```
    scenarios:
      default:
        schema: run driver=cql tags==block:schema …
        rampup: run driver=cql tags==block:rampup …
        main: run driver=cql tags==block:"main.*" …
```


One may notice there is an ‘astra’ scenario included in the file with its own set of activities 
defined (e.g. ‘-astra’).  References to ‘astra’ are simply there to show how additional 
scenarios can be defined in a single workload file.


```
astra:
 	  schema: run driver=cql tags==block:schema-astra threads==1 cycles==UNDEF
	  …
```

This illustrates how flexible and customizable the workload file can become.  The words are 
 customizable and can be tailored for understanding the test case for any business or technical domain.

### Bindings

Values for our three fields during insert, will come from the bindings section of the file.  
Basic examples are included in the cql-starter, but this illustrates how bindings supply 
values to be used by operations.  Again, these are basic, just to illustrate how binding 
functions can be utilized.

```
    bindings:
     machine_id: ElapsedNanoTime(); ToHashedUUID() -> java.util.UUID
     message: Discard(); TextOfFile('data/cql-starter-message.txt');
     rampup_message: ToString();
     time: ElapsedNanoTime(); Mul(1000); ToJavaInstant();
     ts: ElapsedNanoTime(); Mul(1000);
```

Notice how we can reference text from a file to be used for our message value.  Nothing fancy, 
but illustrates how tests can leverage external information from files for decoupling input 
from the workload file itself.  Think of this for things like secret token references, etc. 
that need to be referenced.

```
Discard(); TextOfFile('data/cql-starter-message.txt')
```

Note: The Discard() function is used to indicate a no-op as the initial message value.  This 
may change in the future, but for now it is a necessity due to the nature of bindings 
defaulting to Long values.  This is why the rampup_message was included and it uses a
`ToString();`  as a binding value.  By default the value is 0L.

## Running a workload

Let’s run the cql-starter.

1. Using the nb5 binary, issue the following command

```shell
./nb5 activities/baselines/cql-starter.yaml default hosts=localhost localdc=datacenter1
```
 
This command identifies that the default setting is used with the key-value args passed along 
for use by the cqld4 adapter.

### Examine the results

After the workload has been run, let’s take a look at the results from Cassandra itself using 
 cqlsh.

```shell
docker container exec -it cass4 sh
cqlsh
select * from starter.cqlstarter;
```

You should see the single rampup entry along main operation entries in the Cassandra table.

### Customize

Now, let’s customize the cql-starter to make it a bit more your own.

1. Save the .yaml file to your local environment.
2. Edit the file and uncomment under the default scenario the following entry:


```
   # rampdown: run driver=cql tags==block:rampdown threads==1 cycles==UNDEF
```

When you want to customize the cql-starter, you can simply target the file it outside of the 
 NB5 distribution using:

```shell
./nb5 adapter-cqld4/<rel-path-to-customized-file>.yaml default hosts=localhost localdc=datacenter1
```

Also, if you would like to see more details in the output add (-v, -vv, or -vvv) to the command.

```shell
./nb5 adapter-cqld4/<rel-path-to-customized-file>.yaml default hosts=localhost localdc=datacenter1 -v
```

When the workload is run after uncommenting the rampdown, selecting the content again using 
 cqlsh, returns a table that has been truncated.
