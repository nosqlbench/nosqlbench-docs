NoSQLBench may look like a simplistic runtime for the casual user. This is quite intentional. Yet, a
serious amount of expressive power lies just below the surface for the adventuring tester.

## Dynamic Parameters

Dynamic parameters are control variables which, when assigned to, cause an immediate change in the
behavior of the runtime. Driver implementors have the option to make changes to activity
parameters reactive within the driver. These parameters are thus able to respond to direct
changes from within the scenario script. Additionally, some core parameters are dynamic.

## Global Variables

#### scenario

This is the __Scenario Controller__ object which manages the activity executors in the runtime. All
the methods on this Java type are provided to the scripting environment directly.


### Activity Parameters


#### activities.&lt;alias&gt;.&lt;paramname&gt;

Each activity parameter for a given activity alias is available at this name within the scripting
environment. Thus, you can change the number of threads on an activity named foo (alias=foo) in the
scripting environment by assigning a value to it as in `activities.foo.threads=3`. Any assignments
take effect synchronously before the next line of the script continues executing.

#### __metrics__.&lt;alias&gt;.&lt;metric name&gt;

Each activity metric for a given activity alias is available at this name. This gives you access to
the metrics objects directly. Some metrics objects have also been enhanced with wrapper logic to
provide simple getters and setters, like
`.p99ms` or `.p99ns`, for example.

Interaction with the NoSQLBench runtime and the activities therein is made easy by the above
variables and objects. When an assignment is made to any of these variables, the changes are
propagated to internal listeners. For changes to
_threads_, the thread pool responsible for the affected activity adjusts the number of active
threads (AKA slots). Other changes are further propagated directly to the thread harnesses and
components which implement the ActivityType.

**WARNING:**
Assignment to the _workload_ and _alias_ activity parameters has no special effect, as you can't
change an activity to a different driver once it has been created.

You can make use of more extensive Java or Javascript libraries as needed, mixing then with the
runtime controls provided above.

## Enhanced Metrics for Scripting

The metrics available in NoSQLBench are slightly different than the standard kit with dropwizard
metrics. The key differences are:

### HDR Histograms

All histograms use HDR histograms with *four* significant digits.

All histograms reset on snapshot, automatically keeping all data until you report the snapshot or
access the snapshot via scripting. (see below).

The metric types that use histograms have been replaced with nicer version for scripting. You don't
have to do anything differently in your reporter config to use them. However, if you need to use the
enhanced versions in your local scripting, you can. This means that Timer and Histogram types are
enhanced. If you do not use the scripting extensions, then you will automatically get the standard
behavior that you are used to, only with higher-resolution HDR and full snapshots for each report to
your downstream metrics systems.

### Scripting with Delta Snapshots

For both the timer and the histogram types, you can call getDeltaReader(), or access it simply as
&lt;metric&gt;.deltaReader. When you do this, the delta snapshotting behavior is maintained until
you use the deltaReader to access it. You can get a snapshot from the deltaReader by calling
getDeltaSnapshot(10000), which causes the snapshot to be reset for collection, but retains a cache
of the snapshot for any other consumer of getSnapshot() for that duration in milliseconds. If, for
example, metrics reporters access the snapshot in the next 10 seconds, the reported snapshot will be
exactly what was used in the script.

This is important for using local scripting methods and calculations with aggregate views
downstream. It means that the histograms will match up between your local script output and your
downstream dashboards, as they will both be using the same frame of data, when done properly.

### Histogram Convenience Methods

All histogram snapshots have additional convenience methods for accessing every percentile in (P50,
P75, P90, P95, P98, P99, P999, P9999) and every time unit in (s, ms, us, ns). For example,
getP99ms() is supported, as is getP50ns(), and every other possible combination. This means that you
can access the 99th percentile metric value in your scripts for activity _foo_ as _
metrics.foo.cycles.snapshot.p99ms_.

## Control Flow

When a script is run, it has absolute control over the scenario runtime while it is active. Once the
script reaches its end, however, it will only exit if all activities have completed. If you want to
explicitly stop a script, you must stop all activities.

## Strategies

You can use NoSQLBench in the classic form with `run driver=<activity_type> param=value ...` command
line syntax. There are reasons, however, that you will sometimes want to customize and modify your
scripts directly, such as:

- Permute test variables to cover many sub-conditions in a test.
- Automatically adjust load factors to identify the nominal capacity of a system.
- Adjust rate of a workload in order to get a specific measurement of system behavior.
- React to changes in test or target system state in order to properly sequence a test.

## Script Input & Output

Internal buffers are kept for _stdin_, _stdout_, and _stderr_ for the scenario script execution.
These are logged to the logfile upon script completion, with markers showing the timestamp and file
descriptor (stdin, stdout, or stderr) that each line was recorded from.
