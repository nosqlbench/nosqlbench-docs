You need a target system to run your test against. If you already have one, you can skip this 
section. This tutorial assumes you are testing against a CQL based system. If you need to start 
something up, you have some options:

- [Run DSE in docker](#run-dse-in-docker)
- [Run an Astra Cluster (cloud)](#run-an-astra-cluster)
- [Run Apache Cassandra in docker](#run-apache-cassandra-in-docker)

# Run DSE in docker

You can start an instance of DSE with this one-liner:

    docker run -e DS_LICENSE=accept --name my-dse -p 9042:9042 -d datastax/dse-server:6.8.17-ubi7

# Run an Astra Cluster

You can choose to run a serverless cluster through DataStax AstraDB for functional 
testing. For tips on how to set-up an Astra DB instance, you can check out this 
[[Astra Tutorial](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-intro-to-cassandra#2-create-a-table)].

If you plan to follow along this tutorial using AstraDB, you will need to follow these steps:
- Add a keyspace named 'baselines' to your Astra Database (this is because Astra does not 
  support adding keyspaces through CQLSH), see the following for details:

  ![Keyspace](../keyspace.png)

- In the connect menu of your Astra DB Instance, download your secure connect bundle and make note of its path.

- In your organization settings, you need to generate a Read/Write token and make note of the Client ID and Client Secret.
  see below for details:

## Configuring for AstraDB

The following config pattern is often helpful for configuring NB5 for Astra:

```
... driver=cqld4 scb=<secureconnectbundle> userfile=<userfile> passfile=<passfile> ...
```

This allows you to keep the credentials in files so that they aren't exposed on the console or 
in log files. It is also convenient to put these into a subdirectory together when you are 
testing multiple systems, for example:

```
... driver=cqld4 scb=creds1/scb-somename.zip userfile=creds1/userfile passfile=creds1/passfile ...
```

This makes it easy to manage credentials for multiple endpoints when all you have to do is 
reference a different directory.

ðŸ‘‰ It might be helpful to refer back to this section later when you learn about activity parameters.
