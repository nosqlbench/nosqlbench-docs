You need a target system to run your test against. If you already have one, you can skip this 
section. This tutorial assumes you are testing against a CQL based system. If you need to start 
something up, you have some options:

- [Run DSE in docker](#run-dse-in-docker)
- [Run an Astra Cluster (cloud)](#run-an-astra-cluster)
- [Run Apache Cassandra in docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/cassandra)

# Run DSE in docker

You can start an instance of DSE with this one-liner:

    docker run -e DS_LICENSE=accept --name my-dse -p 9042:9042 -d datastax/dse-server:6.8.17-ubi7

# Run an Astra Cluster

You can choose to run a serverless cluster through DataStax AstraDB for functional 
testing. For tips on how to set-up an Astra DB instance, you can check out this 
[[Astra Tutorial](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-intro-to-cassandra#2-create-a-table)].

If you plan to follow along this tutorial using AstraDB, you will need to follow these steps:
- Add a keyspace named 'baselines' to your Astra Database (this is because Astra does not 
  support adding keyspaces through CQLSH), see the following for details:

  ![Keyspace](/../getting_started/keyspace.png)

- Add an IP to connect to your DB Instance, you can do that by going to the settings of your Astra DB
  and clicking 'Add Access'. Make note of your IP.

- In the connect menu of your Astra DB Instance, download your secure connect bundle and make note of its path.

- In your organization settings, you need to generate a Read/Write token and make note of the Client ID and Client Secret.
  see below for details:

  ![Token](/../getting_started/token.png)

## Configuring for AstraDB

The following config pattern is often helpful for configuring NB5 for Astra:

```
... driver=cqld4 scb=<secureconnectbundle> userfile=<userfile> passfile=<passfile> ...
```

This allows you to keep the credentials in files so that they aren't exposed on the console or 
in log files. It is also convenient to put these into a subdirectory together when you are 
testing multiple systems, for example:

```
... driver=cqld4 scb=creds1/scb-somename.zip userfile=creds1/userfile passfile=creds1/passfile ...
```

This makes it easy to manage credentials for multiple endpoints when all you have to do is 
reference a different directory.
