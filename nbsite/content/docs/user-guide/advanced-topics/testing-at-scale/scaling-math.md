This is a section on scaling math. It's not ready yet.


In general, there is a triangular trade-off between service time, op rate, and data density,
where reads (index traversals or "lookups") are generally more dependent on working set size than
other operations. There is a fundamental three-way trade-off between higher throughput, higher
working set, and lower (better) latency. This is true for all modern databases.
