<article>

  <p>The template forms available in NoSQLBench are very flexible. That means that there are multiple
ways of expressing an operations. Thankfully, in most cases, the forms look like what they do, and
most of the ways you can imagine constructing a statement or operation will simply work, as long as
the required details are provided for which driver you are using.</p>
<h2 id="extended-forms">Extended Forms</h2>
<p>In recent versions of NoSQLBench, there is expanded support for how operations are specified. The
role of the statement has been moved into a field of a uniform op template structure. In essence,
the body of a statement is merely a part of an op template definition, one <em>specifically</em> having 
the field name <code>stmt</code>. However, all definitions which use the previous <em>statement</em> forms should be 
compatible with no significant changes. This is because the <em>String</em> type of value is taken as a 
shortcut for providing a more canonically defined op template containing a <code>stmt</code> field with 
that value. All other forms of statements are structural, and open up new ways to specify 
structured op templates. This greatly simplifies op templates which emulate structured data such 
as JSON, as the template can contain exact models of prototypical operations.</p>
<p>For example, this is a valid op template:</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml" class="language-yaml z-code"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="z-source z-yaml"><span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml"><span class="z-entity z-name z-tag z-yaml">ops</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-key-value z-mapping z-yaml">:</span>
 <span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml"><span class="z-entity z-name z-tag z-yaml">s1</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-key-value z-mapping z-yaml">:</span>
  <span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml"><span class="z-entity z-name z-tag z-yaml">type</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-key-value z-mapping z-yaml">:</span> <span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml">GET</span>
  <span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml"><span class="z-entity z-name z-tag z-yaml">ident</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-key-value z-mapping z-yaml">:</span>
    <span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml"><span class="z-entity z-name z-tag z-yaml">uid</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-key-value z-mapping z-yaml">:</span> <span class="z-constant z-numeric z-integer z-decimal z-yaml">234</span>
    <span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml"><span class="z-entity z-name z-tag z-yaml">group</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-key-value z-mapping z-yaml">:</span> <span class="z-constant z-numeric z-integer z-decimal z-yaml">23</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Whether it is a valid op template through the lens of any given driver is a different question. 
Essentially, if a driver recognizes it as valid, it is valid for that driver. If you are a 
seasoned user of NoSQLBench, you don't have to worry about this form interfering with your 
existing workloads, as the new functionality encapsulates what was there already with no changes 
required.</p>
<h2 id="statement-delimiting">Statement Delimiting</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you want to specify the text of a statement in different ways. Since statements are
strings, the simplest way for small statements is in double quotes. If you need to express a much
longer statement with special characters an newlines, then you can use YAML's literal block
notation (signaled by the '|' character) to do so:</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml" class="language-yaml z-code"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="z-source z-yaml"><span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml"><span class="z-entity z-name z-tag z-yaml">statements</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-key-value z-mapping z-yaml">:</span>
  <span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-block z-sequence z-item z-yaml">-</span> <span class="z-keyword z-control z-flow z-block-scalar z-literal z-yaml">|</span>
<span class="z-string z-unquoted z-block z-yaml">    This is a statement, and the file format doesn&#39;t
    know how statements will be used!
</span>  <span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-block z-sequence z-item z-yaml">-</span> <span class="z-keyword z-control z-flow z-block-scalar z-literal z-yaml">|</span>
<span class="z-string z-unquoted z-block z-yaml">    submit job {alpha} on queue {beta} with options {gamma};
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Notice that the block starts on the following line after the pipe symbol. This is a very popular
form in practice because it treats the whole block exactly as it is shown, except for the initial
indentations, which are removed.</p>
<p>Statements in this format can be raw statements, statement templates, or anything that is
appropriate for the specific activity type they are being used with. Generally, the statements
should be thought of as a statement form that you want to use in your activity -- something that has
placeholders for data bindings. These placeholders are called <em>named anchors</em>. The second line
above is an example of a statement template, with anchors that can be replaced by data for each
cycle of an activity.</p>
<p>There is a variety of ways to represent block statements, with folding, without, with the newline
removed, with it retained, with trailing newlines trimmed or not, and so forth. For a more
comprehensive guide on the YAML conventions regarding multi-line blocks, see
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#Block">YAML Spec 1.2, Chapter 8, Block Styles</a></p>
<h2 id="op-template-sequences">Op Template Sequences</h2>
<p>To provide a degree of flexibility to the user for statement definitions, multiple statements may be
provided together as a sequence.</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml" class="language-yaml z-code"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="z-source z-yaml"><span class="z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-yaml"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-yaml">#</span> a list of statements

  <span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-block z-sequence z-item z-yaml">-</span> <span class="z-string z-quoted z-double z-yaml"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-begin z-yaml">&quot;</span>This a statement.<span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-end z-yaml">&quot;</span></span>

</span></code></pre>
<p>In the first form, the names are provided automatically by the YAML loader. In the second form, they
are specified as ordered map keys.</p>
<h2 id="statement-properties">Statement Properties</h2>
<p>You can also configure individual statements with named properties, using the <strong>statement
properties</strong> form:</p>
<pre data-lang="yaml" class="language-yaml z-code"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="z-source z-yaml"><span class="z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-yaml"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-yaml">#</span> a list of statements with properties

</span></code></pre>
<p>This is the most flexible configuration format at the statement level. It is also the most verbose.
Because this format names each property of the statement, it allows for other properties to be

</span></code></pre>
<p>The rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>You must avoid using both the name property and the initial
<strong><code>&lt;name&gt;: &lt;statement&gt;</code></strong> together. Doing so will cause an error to be thrown.</li>
<li>Do not use the <strong><code>&lt;name&gt;: &lt;statement&gt;</code></strong> form in combination with a
<strong><code>stmt: &lt;statement&gt;</code></strong> property. It is not possible to detect if this occurs. Use caution if you
choose to mix these forms.</li>
</ol>
<p>As explained above, <code>parm1: pvalue1</code> is a <em>free parameter</em>, and is simply shorthand for setting
values in the params map for the statement.</p>
<h2 id="named-statement-maps">Named Statement Maps</h2>
<p>By combining all the forms together with a map in the middle, we get this form, which allows for the
enumeration of multiple statements, each with an obvious name, and a set of properties:</p>

<p>This form is arguably the easiest to read, but retains all the expressive power of the other forms
too. The distinction between this form and the named properties form is that the structure
underneath the first value is a map rather than a single value. Particularly, under the 'foostmt'
name above, all of content contained within it is formatted as properties of it -- indented
properties.</p>
<p>Here are the basic rules for using this form:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each statement is indicated by a YAML list entry like '-'.</li>
<li>Each entry is a map with a single key. This key is taken as the statement name.</li>
<li>The properties of this map work exactly the same as for named properties above, but repeating the
name will throw an error since this is ambiguous.</li>
<li>If the template is being used for CQL or another driver type which expects a 'stmt' property, it
must be provided as an explicitly named 'stmt' property as in the foostmt example above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice in the 'barstmt' example above that there is no &quot;stmt&quot; property. Some drivers have more
flexible op templates may not require this. This is just a property name that was chosen to
represent the &quot;main body&quot; of a statement template in the shorter YAML forms. While the 'stmt'
property is required for drivers like CQL which have a solid concept for &quot;statement body&quot;, it isn't
required for all driver types which may build their operations from other properties.</p>
<h3 id="per-statement-format">Per-Statement Format</h3>
<p>It is indeed possible to use any of the three statement formats within each entry of a statement
sequence:</p>

<p>The above is valid NoSQLBench YAML, although a reader would need to know about the rules explained
above in order to really make sense of it. For most cases, it is best to follow one format
convention, but there is flexibility for overrides and naming when you need it. The main thing to
remember is that the statement form is determined on an element-by-element basis for maximum
flexibility.</p>
